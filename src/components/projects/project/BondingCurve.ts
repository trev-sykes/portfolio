// Defining the inspiration for the project
const inspiration: string = `The inspiration behind the Bonding Curve Simulator comes from a personal curiosity about how markets and decentralized economies work. 
I wanted to explore how the concept of a bonding curve, often used in tokenomics, affects the price of assets in a dynamic, self-sustaining system. 
This project allowed me to visualize this complex concept by simulating a marketplace where trades are randomly executed, and the results are reflected in real-time as price movements and volume trends. 
Ultimately, my goal was to create a tool that would help others better understand the dynamics of bonding curves and the broader principles of economic systems in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.`;

    summary: `The Bonding Curve Simulator is an interactive price simulator that models the behavior of assets within a bonding curve market. 
    Using a simple algorithm, it dynamically calculates the price of an asset based on the total amount of trades made, creating an intuitive visual representation of price evolution and volume over time.
    The chart updates in real-time as trades occur, providing immediate feedback and helping users understand the inherent price volatility and liquidity mechanics at play in such a system.`,
